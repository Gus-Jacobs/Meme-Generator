# Meme-Generator
Developed by Gus Jacobs
randomly selects memes from one of two folders, displaying it in proper size and allowing the user to go back and forth between previous and new memes. Once all memes have been used you can quit or reshuffle. It was developed to try to enhance Python abilities, specifically with using default library tkinter for GUI elements.
